#  Dockerfiles

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the creation and use of Dockerfiles. This guide assumes a foundational understanding of Docker and container management. If you are not yet comfortable with Docker containers, it is recommended to practice with them to ensure you have the necessary background knowledge.

The scenario we will be working with involves a simple Python Flask application. This application currently runs natively on the system, but we aim to "dockerize" it for better dependency management and isolation. Dockerizing an application involves creating a Dockerfile, a script that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image for our application.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Docker and container management
- A working Python Flask application
- Docker installed on your system

## Flask Application Overview

Our Flask application is straightforward; it simply outputs "Hello World". The application consists of two main files:

1. `app.py` - The main Flask application file.
2. `requirements.txt` - A file listing the Python dependencies required by the application.

### `app.py`
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

### `requirements.txt`
```
Flask==1.1.2
```

## Creating a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands to assemble an image. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to create a Dockerfile for our Flask application.

### Step 1: Base Image

We start by specifying the base image. In our case, we will use a minimal Python 3.7 image.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.7-slim
```

### Step 2: Set the Working Directory

Next, we set the working directory inside the container where our application code will reside.

```Dockerfile
# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
```

### Step 3: Add Application Files

We need to copy the application files (`app.py` and `requirements.txt`) from our local machine to the container.

```Dockerfile
# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

We then install the required Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

```Dockerfile
# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Expose the Application Port

Docker containers have their own network namespaces. To make the Flask application accessible, we must expose the port it listens on.

```Dockerfile
# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80
```

### Step 6: Define the Command to Run the Application

Finally, we specify the command to run the Flask application.

```Dockerfile
# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Complete Dockerfile

Below is the complete Dockerfile.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Building and Running the Docker Image

With our Dockerfile in place, we can now build and run the Docker image.

### Build the Docker Image

Run the following command in the directory containing your Dockerfile:

```sh
docker build -t flask-app .
```

This command builds the image and tags it as `flask-app`.

### Run the Docker Container

To run the Docker container from the image, use the following command:

```sh
docker run -p 4000:80 flask-app
```

This command maps port 80 in the container to port 4000 on the host machine. You can now access the Flask application by navigating to `http://localhost:4000` in your web browser.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have created a Dockerfile to dockerize a simple Flask application. We walked through the process of setting up the Dockerfile, building the Docker image, and running the container. Dockerizing your applications ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production, simplifying dependency management and deployment.
