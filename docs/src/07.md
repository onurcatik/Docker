# Verifying the Installation

In this tutorial, we will verify the installation of Docker on your system. This ensures that Docker and Docker Compose are correctly set up and ready for use. We will cover how to use the command line to check Docker's status and understand the output of various Docker commands.

## 1. Open the Terminal

Regardless of your operating system, you will need to open a terminal or command prompt. The following steps will guide you based on your OS:

- **Linux/Mac**: Open a terminal and use the `sudo` command for administrative privileges.
- **Windows**: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator (no `sudo` required).

## 2. Check Docker Info

To verify that Docker is installed and running correctly, use the `docker info` command. This command provides detailed information about your Docker installation, including configuration and operational details.

### Command

For Linux/Mac:

```sh
sudo docker info
```

For Windows:

```sh
docker info
```

### Expected Output

The output should contain various sections detailing your Docker setup, similar to the following example:

```
Containers: 1
 Running: 1
 Paused: 0
 Stopped: 0
Images: 71
Server Version: 18.09.6-ce
Storage Driver: overlay2
 ...
Logging Driver: json-file
 ...
Operating System: Arch Linux
OSType: linux
Architecture: x86_64
CPUs: 8
Total Memory: 11.68GiB
 ...
```

### Explanation of Key Sections

- **Containers**: Shows the total number of containers, categorized by their state (running, paused, stopped).
- **Images**: The number of Docker images stored on your system.
- **Server Version**: The version of Docker that is running.
- **Storage Driver**: The storage driver Docker is using (e.g., overlay2).
- **Operating System**: The OS Docker is running on.
- **CPUs**: Number of CPU cores Docker has access to.
- **Total Memory**: Total RAM available to Docker.

## 3. List Running Containers

To list all running containers and get more detailed information about them, use the `docker ps` command. This command is analogous to the `ps` command in Linux, which lists running processes.

### Command

For Linux/Mac:

```sh
sudo docker ps
```

For Windows:

```sh
docker ps
```

### Expected Output

The output should list all active containers, as shown below:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
b6b47b3b16b0        mysql:5.7           "docker-entrypointâ€¦"   34 minutes ago      Up 34 minutes       3306/tcp            awesome_mysql
```

### Explanation of Key Columns

- **CONTAINER ID**: Unique identifier for the container.
- **IMAGE**: The Docker image the container is based on.
- **COMMAND**: The command that is running inside the container.
- **CREATED**: How long ago the container was created.
- **STATUS**: Current status of the container (e.g., Up 34 minutes).
- **PORTS**: Ports exposed by the container.
- **NAMES**: User-friendly name assigned to the container.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues where the `docker info` or `docker ps` commands do not work as expected, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure that the Docker daemon is running.
- Verify that Docker is installed correctly by following the official Docker installation guides.
- Check for any error messages in the terminal output and refer to the Docker documentation or community forums for solutions.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you should now be able to verify your Docker installation and understand the output of key Docker commands. This knowledge is crucial for efficiently managing Docker containers and ensuring your development environment is set up correctly.

For any further assistance, consider reaching out through appropriate support channels or forums.
