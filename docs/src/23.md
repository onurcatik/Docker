# Environment Variables

In this tutorial, we will delve into the use and management of environment variables within Docker. Environment variables are essential for storing sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and configuration settings, which should not be hardcoded into your application. Instead, they can be dynamically passed to your application at runtime, enhancing security and flexibility. This tutorial will cover how to use environment variables in Docker effectively.

## Understanding Environment Variables

Environment variables are key-value pairs that can influence the behavior of running processes on a computer. In the context of Docker, they are used to pass configuration data to containers, allowing for more flexible and reusable Docker images.

### Why Use Environment Variables?

1. **Security**: Sensitive data like passwords and API keys should not be hardcoded into your application code or Dockerfiles. Instead, they should be passed as environment variables to keep them secure.
2. **Configurability**: Environment variables allow you to easily change configuration values without modifying your application code.
3. **Portability**: Using environment variables helps in maintaining the portability of Docker images across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Practical Implementation

### Example Application

We will use a simple Flask application to demonstrate the use of environment variables. This application will greet the user based on an environment variable named `NAME`.

### Step 1: Create the Flask Application

Create a directory for your project and add the following files:

#### `app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    name = os.getenv('NAME', 'World')
    return f'Hello, {name}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

This application reads the `NAME` environment variable and uses it to greet the user. If the variable is not set, it defaults to "World".

### Step 2: Create the Dockerfile

Next, create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Flask application:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install flask

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t flask-env-app .
```

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

Run the container with the default environment variable:

```sh
docker run -p 80:80 flask-env-app
```

Visit `http://localhost` in your web browser. You should see the message "Hello, World!".

### Step 5: Overriding Environment Variables

You can override the environment variable when running the container using the `-e` flag:

```sh
docker run -p 80:80 -e NAME=Foo flask-env-app
```

Now, visiting `http://localhost` should display "Hello, Foo!".

### Step 6: Using Environment Variables in Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You can use it to manage environment variables more conveniently.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: flask-env-app
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - NAME=Bar
```

Run the application using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Visiting `http://localhost` should display "Hello, Bar!".

## Security Considerations

- **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Dockerfiles**: Since Dockerfiles are often shared, avoid hardcoding sensitive information in them.
- **Use Docker Secrets for Sensitive Information**: For production environments, consider using Docker secrets to manage sensitive data securely.

## Conclusion

Environment variables are a powerful feature in Docker, providing flexibility, security, and configurability to your applications. By leveraging environment variables, you can ensure that your Docker images are both reusable and secure across different environments. This tutorial covered the basics of using environment variables in Docker, including how to set and override them, as well as best practices for managing sensitive information.
