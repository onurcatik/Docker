# WebApps and Port Mapping

In this tutorial, we will focus on running a web application using Docker, specifically with Nginx as the web server. We will also cover the concept of port mapping to enable access to the web application from outside the Docker container. 

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can verify your Docker installation by running:

```sh
docker --version
```

## Running an Nginx Container

Nginx is a popular web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. To start with, we will pull the Nginx image from Docker Hub and run it as a container.

### Step 1: Pull the Nginx Image

First, we need to pull the Nginx image from Docker Hub. Open your terminal and run:

```sh
sudo docker pull nginx
```

### Step 2: Run the Nginx Container

Next, we will run the Nginx container. The following command will start an Nginx container:

```sh
sudo docker run --name mynginx -d nginx
```

Here, `--name mynginx` names the container "mynginx", and `-d` runs the container in detached mode.

### Step 3: Accessing the Web Application

The container is now running, but we cannot access it from our host system yet. Docker containers are isolated by default and do not expose their ports to the host system. To access the Nginx web server, we need to map a port from the host system to the container.

## Port Mapping

Port mapping allows us to forward a port from the host system to the container, enabling external access to the services running inside the container.

### Step 4: Port Forwarding

To map port 5000 on your host system to port 80 on the Nginx container, use the following command:

```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:80 nginx
```

In this command:
- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 5000:80` maps port 5000 on the host to port 80 in the container.

### Step 5: Verify the Port Mapping

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the default Nginx welcome page, indicating that the web server is running correctly and the port mapping is functioning as expected.

### Step 6: Checking Logs

To check the logs generated by the Nginx server, you can use the following command:

```sh
sudo docker logs <container_id>
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID or name of your Nginx container.

### Example Log Output

The log output will display information such as the IP address of the client accessing the server and the user agent string, which indicates the browser used by the client.

## Running Nginx in the Background

To keep your Nginx container running without needing to keep the terminal open, use detached mode as shown in the previous examples (`-d` flag).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to:
1. Pull and run an Nginx Docker image.
2. Use port mapping to access the Nginx server from the host system.
3. Check logs to monitor access to the Nginx server.

These steps provide a basic yet powerful way to run and manage web applications using Docker. In the next tutorial, we will explore more advanced topics such as persistent storage and custom configurations for Nginx.

### Next Steps

In future tutorials, we will cover:
- Customizing Nginx configurations
- Setting up persistent storage
- Deploying more complex web applications

By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to use Docker for hosting web applications and other services efficiently.
