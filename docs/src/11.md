# The Detached Mode

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will examine the detached mode in Docker. Detached mode is a powerful feature that allows you to run containers in the background, enabling you to continue using your terminal for other tasks. This tutorial will guide you through the use of detached mode, addressing any inaccuracies and providing detailed, precise instructions and code snippets.

## Understanding Detached Mode

### Scenario

Consider a scenario where you need to start a service on a remote server, such as a Raspberry Pi. After starting the service, you do not want to remain connected via SSH. Alternatively, you may wish to run a Docker container locally and then close your terminal without stopping the container. In both cases, detached mode is the solution.

### Running a Container in Foreground

To understand the need for detached mode, let's first look at running a Docker container in the foreground. 

```bash
docker run ubuntu
```

Running the above command will start an Ubuntu container, but it will keep you attached to the container's process. You won't be able to use your terminal for other tasks unless you stop the container by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

### Problems with Foreground Mode

Running a container in the foreground has its limitations:

- You cannot perform other tasks in the same terminal.
- The container stops when you exit the terminal.

### Enter Detached Mode

To overcome these limitations, Docker provides the detached mode. By running a container in detached mode, you can start the container and immediately return to your terminal prompt.

## Using Detached Mode

### Starting a Container in Detached Mode

To start a container in detached mode, use the `-d` flag:

```bash
docker run -d ubuntu
```

When you run this command, Docker will start the container and return the container ID, allowing you to continue using your terminal.

```bash
$ docker run -d ubuntu
f5a5a5c8b979ea2f12c5e6bdc2e9f8a848b26e304f7a1b08a8c4d9f8b7f4c4d5
```

### Checking Running Containers

To verify that your container is running, use the `docker ps` command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will list all running containers, including those running in detached mode.

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
f5a5a5c8b979   ubuntu    "/bin/bash"   5 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds             jovial_bose
```

### Interacting with Detached Containers

Even though your container is running in detached mode, you can still interact with it. For example, you can execute commands within the container using `docker exec`:

```bash
docker exec -it f5a5a5c8b979 bash
```

This command will open a new bash session inside the running container.

### Stopping Detached Containers

To stop a container running in detached mode, use the `docker stop` command followed by the container ID or name:

```bash
docker stop f5a5a5c8b979
```

This will gracefully stop the container.

## Conclusion

Detached mode is an essential feature for running Docker containers in the background. It allows you to start containers, continue using your terminal, and manage containers efficiently. In this tutorial, we have covered the basics of using detached mode, from starting and verifying containers to interacting with and stopping them.

In the next tutorial, we will explore more advanced topics, such as managing and monitoring detached containers. Stay tuned!

## Summary

- **Foreground Mode**: Keeps terminal attached to the container.
- **Detached Mode**: Use the `-d` flag to run containers in the background.
- **Check Containers**: Use `docker ps` to list running containers.
- **Interact with Containers**: Use `docker exec` to execute commands inside containers.
- **Stop Containers**: Use `docker stop` to stop running containers.

By understanding and using detached mode, you can effectively manage your Docker containers and optimize your workflow.
