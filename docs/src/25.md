# Node.js Deployment with Docker

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will cover the deployment of a Node.js application using Docker. We will discuss the creation of a Docker image, setting up the working directory, managing dependencies, and running the Docker container. This tutorial assumes that you have a working knowledge of Node.js. We will focus solely on the Docker-related aspects of the deployment process.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Node.js.
2. Docker installed on your system.
3. Basic knowledge of working with the command line.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare the Node.js Application

First, ensure that your Node.js application is ready. For this tutorial, we will use a simple Node.js application that utilizes Express.

**package.json:**

```json
{
  "name": "nodejs-docker-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js app for Docker deployment",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.1"
  }
}
```

**app.js:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const PORT = 80;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### 2. Create the Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands to assemble an image. Here is a simple Dockerfile for our Node.js application.

**Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image from the Docker Hub
FROM node:8

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 3. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing your Node.js application and Dockerfile. Use the following command to build the Docker image.

```sh
sudo docker build -t nodejs-docker-app .
```

This command will create a Docker image named `nodejs-docker-app`. The `.` at the end signifies the current directory as the build context.

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run a container using the image. Use the following command to start the container.

```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 nodejs-docker-app
```

The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, and `-p 80:80` maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.

### 5. Verify the Deployment

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the message "Hello World".

### Recap and Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of deploying a Node.js application using Docker. We created a Dockerfile, built a Docker image, and ran a Docker container. This process helps ensure that your application runs consistently across different environments.

By following these steps, you can deploy your Node.js applications efficiently with Docker, taking advantage of its capabilities to create portable, isolated, and reproducible environments for your software.
