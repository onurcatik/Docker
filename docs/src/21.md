# Building and Running Dockerfiles

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building and running a Docker image using a Dockerfile. This tutorial aims to provide a thorough and precise guide for developers who want to containerize their applications using Docker. 

## Understanding Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using a Dockerfile, we can automate the steps of setting up an environment for our application, ensuring consistency and repeatability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, follow the instructions on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker for your operating system.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Creating a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory. This file will contain instructions for building the Docker image.

Here is an example Dockerfile for a simple Flask application:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 2. Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image from your Dockerfile, use the `docker build` command. Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker build -t my-flask-app .
```

Here, `-t` allows you to tag your image with a name (`my-flask-app`), and the `.` indicates the current directory where the Dockerfile is located.

### 3. Running the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run it using the `docker run` command. The following command will start the container and map port 80 of the container to port 5000 on your local machine:

```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:80 my-flask-app
```

Here, `-d` runs the container in detached mode, and `-p` maps the containerâ€™s port 80 to port 5000 on your local machine.

### 4. Viewing the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see your Flask application running.

### 5. Stopping the Docker Container

To stop the running container, you can use the `docker stop` command followed by the container ID. First, list the running containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

Then, stop the container using its container ID:

```bash
sudo docker stop <container_id>
```

### 6. Rebuilding the Image

If you make changes to your application code, you need to rebuild the Docker image and restart the container. Use the following commands to rebuild and rerun the container:

```bash
sudo docker build -t my-flask-app .
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:80 my-flask-app
```

Alternatively, if you want to run the container on a different port, you can specify the new port:

```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:80 my-flask-app
```

Then, access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can containerize your Flask application using Docker. This process ensures that your application runs in a consistent environment, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy. Docker's automation and consistency reduce the likelihood of environment-related issues and streamline the deployment process.

## Sample Code

Here is a complete example of the Dockerfile and the commands to build and run a Docker image:

### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Commands

```bash
# Build the Docker image
sudo docker build -t my-flask-app .

# Run the Docker container
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:80 my-flask-app

# List running containers
sudo docker ps

# Stop the running container
sudo docker stop <container_id>

# Rebuild the Docker image after making changes
sudo docker build -t my-flask-app .

# Rerun the Docker container on a different port
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:80 my-flask-app
```

By adhering to these instructions, you ensure a systematic and error-free approach to Dockerizing your applications.
